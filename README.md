# addon-welcomewarpsigns
Add-on for BentoBox to add personal warp signs for players of BSkyBlock or AcidIsland.
This add-on will work for both game modes.

## How to use

1. Place the jar in the addons folder of the BentoBox plugin
2. Restart the server
3. The addon will create a data folder and inside the folder will be a config.yml
4. Edit the config.yml how you want
5. Restart the server if you make a change

## Config.yml

There are only two options in the config:

### warplevelrestriction

This is the minimum island level needed to be able to create a warp.
0 or negative values will disable this restriction and 10 is default.
If you do not have the level addon installed, this will have no effect.

### Warp Sign Text - welcomeLine

This is the text a player must put on the first line of the sign to make it a warp sign.
